# Python-Portfolio

Here is a portfolio composed of python coding experience complemented with concepts in physics and mathematics. 
Each file contains a different project for viewing and the associated files for certain projects are given as well. 
Supplemental material can be found for some projects but is not totally necessary for understanding at a surface level. 
Some knowledge in certain concepts is assumed. 

For any further questions, my email is: ANB262@pitt.edu
